# Theory
- A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR INTERACTIVE CARTOGRAPHIC STORYTELLING N/A, 2018. [[paper](https://library.itc.utwente.nl/papers_2018/msc/gfm/LandaverdeCortes.pdf)]

# Dataset
- [ROCStories Corpora](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/): a new corpus of five-sentence commonsense stories. This corpus is unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for story generation
- [TimeTravel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/150jP5FEHqJD3TmTO_8VGdgqBftTDKn4w/view): counterfactual context.
- [ConceptNet](https://ttic.uchicago.edu/~kgimpel/commonsense.html) commonsense knowledge representation.
- [ATOMIC](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/atomic/): An Atlas of Machine Commonsense for If-Then Reasoning
